# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

### Mandatory Domain Requirements (Home Automation Web App)

- **FR-006**: System MUST implement role-based access with authorized users and registered devices only.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide user profiles with customizable preferences and behavior rules.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support widget-based dashboard composition (add, remove, reorder, configure).
- **FR-009**: System MUST expose secure API endpoints for device control and profile-driven automation.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide an isolated administration surface (logical or separate project) with stronger controls.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support push notifications for actionable domotic events.
- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve strict typing across frontend and backend contracts.
- **FR-013**: System MUST define compatibility strategy for integrating new devices/providers incrementally.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

Recommended entities for this domain:

- **UserProfile**: user identity, permissions, personalization settings, behavior policies.
- **RegisteredDevice**: known user devices allowed to access the app.
- **HomeDevice**: connected domotic device (type, provider, capabilities, status).
- **WidgetConfig**: dashboard widget configuration and layout metadata.
- **AutomationRule**: rule linking profile/context to domotic actions.
- **SecurityEvent**: auditable security log entry.

## Security & Access *(mandatory)*

- Authentication method(s), session lifecycle and credential hardening
- Authorization model (roles/scopes) and admin perimeter isolation
- Device registration and trusted-device policy
- Abuse protection, rate limiting, and audit logging expectations
- Data protection requirements (at rest/in transit) and incident response basics

## UX & Personalization *(mandatory)*

- Key UX principles (clarity, simplicity, modern look, feedback and recoverability)
- Personalization scope (profiles, dashboard layout, widget preferences)
- Accessibility baseline and responsive behavior assumptions

## Test Strategy *(mandatory)*

- Define unit, integration and contract test scope for each user story
- Include success, error and warning scenarios for critical paths
- Define measurable coverage targets and pass/fail quality gates
- Require independent testability for each prioritized user story

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

## Assumptions

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right assumptions based on reasonable defaults
  chosen when the feature description did not specify certain details.
-->

- [Assumption about target users, e.g., "Users have stable internet connectivity"]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries, e.g., "Mobile support is out of scope for v1"]
- [Assumption about data/environment, e.g., "Existing authentication system will be reused"]
- [Dependency on existing system/service, e.g., "Requires access to the existing user profile API"]
